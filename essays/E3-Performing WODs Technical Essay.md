The most recent WOD before this E3 Essay was Invoice1. For Invoice1 we are required to make a receipt of at least 5 products. It must include the product, quantity, price, and totals. Everything was going well until inputting the products variables and data. I got stuck at displaying the grand totals, and making the product rows. Once I couldn't figure out how to solve the road bump after looking through the labs and online resources I resorted to watching the example screencast. The step by step process in the video was very helpful and after I commpleted one round I tried to improve my time by redoing it a few hours later. Int he future I would work on the WOD's earlier so the labs we have worked on is still fresh in my mind.
