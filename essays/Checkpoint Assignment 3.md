  The shopping cart is going to be on a separate page that the user can view their purchased items and its product information. To access the shopping cart the user must be logged on to their account to view the products they plan to purchase. The user will be able to view the product quantity, the total price of each product and the total sum. The user can also change their shopping cart, such as add or remove products in their cart.
  While the user can check out the products without logging in they will be redirected to a login page where they either have to create an account or login to a previous account. Security concerns that I must address is having the users private information hidden and only have certain things viewable once they are logged in such as their shopping cart.
  How I plan to provide personalization to my UI once a user is successfully logged in is their name should show on the webpage so they know they are on the proper account. It should show on the products page and also their shopping cart page. Just like the previous question the users shopping cart will not be viewable until on an account.
  If working with partners we plan to split up the work evenly and will have a voice call or some sort of communication working on it at the same time. We will schedule a time when we can get on at the same time so we can work on it together. We plan to go through each area step by step so we are on the same page and will be able to help one another when we get stuck. Although this is a slower process it will be more helpful so we don't miss a line of code that is mistyped or wrong.
  I plan to give myself more time to work on the assignment as there is a set deadline for assignment 3 and I will not be able to resubmit and correct my work. I will have to quickly fix the areas that I was stuck on in assignment 2 as assignment 3 requires previous code from assignment 2 and adds more to it.
